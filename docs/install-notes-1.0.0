Install and run Apache ActiveMQ Classic (optional)
    1. If you prefer an external broker, download ActiveMQ from https://activemq.apache.org/components/classic/download/
    2. Extract the archive and run `./bin/activemq start` (or `activemq.bat start` on Windows)
    3. The broker will listen on `tcp://localhost:61616` by default

The application now starts an embedded broker automatically, so installing ActiveMQ is no longer required for development.
