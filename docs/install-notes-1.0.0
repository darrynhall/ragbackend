Install and run Apache ActiveMQ Artemis (optional)
    1. If you prefer an external broker, download Artemis from https://activemq.apache.org/components/artemis/download/
    2. Extract the archive and run `./bin/artemis run` (or `artemis.bat run` on Windows)
    3. The broker will listen on `tcp://localhost:61616` by default

The application now starts an embedded Artemis broker automatically, so installing Artemis is no longer required for development.
